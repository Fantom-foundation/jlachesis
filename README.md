# jLachesis

A Java-version of Lachesis implementation (available at https://github.com/Fantom-foundation/go-lachesis)

The main goal of the project is to provide a prototype of a DAG-based consensus protocol written in Java.
By using an OO language, it hopes to give a clear design and architecture (to those who are fans of Java :))
of the consensus protocol.

# Roadmap

jLachesis aims to deliver a prototype that preserves the semantics of Lachesis protocol.
We use this as a base for our other research projects.

# Requirements

You will need the following to compile:

Java jdk 1.8+
Maven 2+

Code has been developed and tested mainly on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.


# Compile & run

Basic maven:
mvn clean compile

For code development, it's better to use an IDE (such as Eclipse).

# Progress

The conversion from GoLang code to Java is complete. The journey was extremely fun.

Will put a tutorial to showcase as well as to give lessons learnt though the process.

# Contact

The project is still in the early state. So we are welcome to any feedbacks.
